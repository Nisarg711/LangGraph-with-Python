Dear Professor Verma,

I am writing to inform you that I will be taking a leave of absence for one week, from [Start Date] to [End Date], due to medical reasons.

I understand that this will cause me to miss some classes during this period. I will make sure to catch up on all missed lectures and coursework as soon as I return. I will also reach out to classmates for notes and any important announcements.

I will submit my medical certificate to you as soon as it is available.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
