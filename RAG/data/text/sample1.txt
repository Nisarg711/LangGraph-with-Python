The evening settled in slowly, wrapping the streets in a calm that felt almost deliberate. 
Lights flickered on in distant windows, each one hinting at a separate story unfolding behind glass and curtains. 
Somewhere, a radio played an old song, its melody drifting through the air and mixing with the muted sounds of traffic and footsteps. Thoughts wandered without direction, jumping from memory to possibility, lingering where they felt comfortable. 
There was no rush to arrive at a conclusion, no need for a dramatic ending—just the quiet satisfaction of existing within the moment, letting it pass gently and without resistance.
